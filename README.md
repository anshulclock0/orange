Writers: The project was written as a collective effort by Anshul Rai Sharma and Ayush Lahiri

System requirments
The user needs to run the file game.py in order to see the project and understand the following details about it.
This project was built on a Windows 8 system with 4 GB ram and i3 processor. The language used to write this is python 2.7. 


The Project
The writers of this project wanted to build a simple naming game based on a 3x3 matrix. The aim was simple: Whichever user can complete the matrix first, that user's house will win the game. To give it an interesting taste we sought to use house names from the famous franchise Harry Potter. 
The game uses various funtions in order to execute the above tasks. The makers wanted to understand the basis of python and their manipulation to achieve various tasks. Also the users are adviced to make use of the list of names provided in the source code in order to run the game succesfully since writing the names of all members of the two houses(Griffindor and slytherin) was not possible due to the blessing of Rowlin and Pottermore.  
Basic functioning of the game is this, it is a dual player game, it asks the user1 to begin by choosing a house name, then that user has to complete the matrix by nameing 9 names of members belonging to that house. If the user gets one name wrong, user2 gets the chance to begin naming the names of other house(than user1) and complete the matrix. This house changing goes on till the matrix is incomplete. The moment the 9th column of the matrix is filled with a name, its user's assigned house wins.
